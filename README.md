# Restaurant Reviews application

## Project Overview

For the **Restaurant Reviews** projects, the student convert a static webpage to a mobile-ready web application: take a static design that lacks accessibility and convert the design to be responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use. You will also add a service worker to begin the process of creating a seamless offline experience for your users.

### Specification

Student has been provided the code for a restaurant reviews website. The code has a lot of issues. It was barely usable on a desktop browser, much less a mobile device. It also didn’t include any standard accessibility features, and it didn’t work offline at all. Student job was to update the code to resolve these issues while still maintaining the included functionality.

## How to run the application?

Clone or download this repository and start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer. Python has some simple tools to do this, and you don't even need to know Python. For most people, it's already installed on your computer.

In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: python -V. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000 (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use python3 -m http.server 8000. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's website to download and install the software.

    With your server running, visit the site: http://localhost:8000.
